# Error Analysis in Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing various error analysis techniques in machine learning. It covers concepts such as confusion matrices, sensitivity, precision, specificity, F1 score, and approaches to handling bias and variance issues.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain without external references:

### General
- What is the confusion matrix?
- What is type I error? Type II error?
- What is sensitivity? Specificity? Precision? Recall?
- What is an F1 score?
- What is bias? Variance?
- What is irreducible error?
- What is Bayes error?
- How can you approximate Bayes error?
- How to calculate bias and variance
- How to create a confusion matrix

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following tasks:

1. **Create Confusion Matrix** (`0-create_confusion.py`)
   - Implement a function to create a confusion matrix.

2. **Sensitivity** (`1-sensitivity.py`)
   - Calculate the sensitivity for each class in a confusion matrix.

3. **Precision** (`2-precision.py`)
   - Calculate the precision for each class in a confusion matrix.

4. **Specificity** (`3-specificity.py`)
   - Calculate the specificity for each class in a confusion matrix.

5. **F1 Score** (`4-f1_score.py`)
   - Calculate the F1 score of a confusion matrix.

6. **Dealing with Error** (`5-error_handling`)
   - Provide approaches to handle different bias-variance scenarios.

7. **Compare and Contrast** (`6-compare_and_contrast`)
   - Analyze given confusion matrices and determine the most important issue.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.5)
- Files executed with `numpy` (version 1.15)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All modules, classes, and functions must be documented
- All files must be executable

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, use the following format:
```
./script_name.py
```
For example:
```
./0-main.py
```
